# goban-pic : Edit photo for WordPress background

I accidently fubarred the SSGC WordPress background img. Tom sent me his copy in .docx, unsuitable; so I will crop with GIMP and get a variety of sizes, and see what works least bad.

## Sizes

I have 6 .xcf files, with these dims (an excuse to use MD tables):

| An excuse | to use MD | tables   |
|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|  387x100  |  387x120  |  387x135 |
|  387x150  |  387x175  |  387x200 |

## Solve the problem (don't admire it)

Next step -- research proper img dim for the theme we're using; trial-and-error, if need be.
If that fails, then choose a different theme.  (That "Editor" theme actually looks good, at first glance.)

## Been doing this wrong

Don't edit the master branch!!1!  Instead, create a **new** branch, edit that, then merge it back into the master branch!!1!

## SSGC WordPress status

We're using the "ShoreDitch" theme.
https://wordpress.com/theme/shoreditch
(Useful links for customization.)

The "pages" all have the same "featured image", except for "Welcome" (which has a honkin' huge image, mostly fills the screen) and "Blog Posts" (where I haven't figured out yet how to display a featured image -- maybe change, in the Customizer, content settings to "use first image as featured image" and then add an image to each blog post).

The images are pretty crappy -- pixelated and muddy.  I'll check next week whether Tom has better; and I'll try again to find my older stuff.

That's all for now; time to snowboard!
