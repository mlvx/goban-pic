# goban-pic : Edit photo for WordPress background

I accidently fubarred the SSGC WordPress background img. Tom sent me his copy in .docx, unsuitable; so I will crop with GIMP and get a variety of sizes, and see what works least bad.

## Sizes

I have 6 .xcf files, with these dims:

| Just an excuse to use MD tables |
|:-------------------------------:|
|  387x100  | 387x120  |  387x135 |
|           |          |          |
|  387x150  | 387x175  |  387x200 |

## Solve the problem (don't admire it)

Next step -- research proper img dim for the theme we're using; trial-and-error, if need be.
If that fails, then choose a different theme.  (That "Editor" theme actually looks good, at first glance.)
