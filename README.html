<p>I accidently fubarred the SSGC WordPress background img. Tom sent me his copy in .docx, unsuitable; so I will crop with GIMP and get a variety of sizes, and see what works least bad.</p>
<h2 id="sizes">Sizes</h2>
<p>I have 6 .xcf files, with these dims (an excuse to use MD tables):</p>

<p>Next step -- research proper img dim for the theme we're using; trial-and-error, if need be. If that fails, then choose a different theme. (That &quot;Editor&quot; theme actually looks good, at first glance.)</p>

<p>Don't edit the master branch!!1! Instead, create a <strong>new</strong> branch, edit that, then merge it back into the master branch!!1!</p>
<h2 id="ssgc-wordpress-status">SSGC WordPress status</h2>
<p>We're using the &quot;ShoreDitch&quot; theme. https://wordpress.com/theme/shoreditch (Useful links for customization.)</p>
<p>The &quot;pages&quot; all have the same &quot;featured image&quot;, except for &quot;Welcome&quot; (which has a honkin' huge image, mostly fills the screen) and &quot;Blog Posts&quot; (where I haven't figured out yet how to display a featured image -- maybe change, in the Customizer, content settings to &quot;use first image as featured image&quot; and then add an image to each blog post).</p>
<p>The images are pretty crappy -- pixelated and muddy. I'll check next week whether Tom has better; and I'll try again to find my older stuff.</p>
<p>That's all for now; time to snowboard!</p>
